Okay, so this project requires a little explanation. The goal is to generate code from the RTTR data located in the various source files, but this becomes a problem with the build system since we can't know, ahead of compile time, which source files are going to be generated. So, what we do has many phases to it. The first phase is to compile and link the source files with the CodeGen.cpp. Once we have the CodeGen tool, it is used with the templates to export the various source files we need. After this... who knows what will happen. I haven't worked out that far ahead yet!
